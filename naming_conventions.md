# Naming Conventions
Overall, I am trying to follow the general C++ naming conventions.

## Classes
Classes should be named using CamelCase.

### Private Member Variables
Private member variables should be prefixed with 'm' to indicate they are member variables. The name should be in camelCase.
- For example, `mSensorData`.

### Private Member Pointers
Private member pointers should be prefixed with 'p' to indicate they are pointers. The name should be in camelCase.
- For example, `pSensorData`.

## Functions
Functions should be named using camelCase. This includes member functions, free functions, and static functions.

## Variables
Variables should be named using camelCase. This includes member variables, local variables, and global variables.

## Constants
Constants should be named using ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES. This includes both compile-time constants and runtime constants.

## Enums
Enums should be named using CamelCase, and the enum values should be named using ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
